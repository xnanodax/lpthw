These are my exercise codes from "Learn Python the Hard Way" (3rd edition) by Zed Shaw.

I have learned so much from Zed Shaw and from the numerous posts from people across the internet.

I have provided these codes in hopes that it may help anyone with these exercises as I have received so much help myself.

Thank you so much for reading this file,
