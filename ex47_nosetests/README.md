In exercise 47's, we learned how to use automated testing of a game skeleton using Nose Tools.

I've also added an test option to 
1) equip a weapon and add the weapon stats to the user's stats.
2) swap weapons

How To Use
In the directory ABOVE the ex47_nosetests_tests.py file, execute the tests by typing "nosetests" into the PowerShell command.
